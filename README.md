## Architecture Overview

## Features

### Real-Time Data (When Market Is Open)

- A Kafka producer fetches stock prices from Yahoo Finance every 5 seconds.
- A Kafka consumer writes the live stream into a local CSV time-series database.
- A Streamlit dashboard visualizes metrics + charts and updates automatically.
- Delta values are calculated against the previous close price.

### Automatic Market-Closed Fallback

When the market is closed (weekends, holidays, after-hours):

- Kafka producer/consumer do not start.
- Dashboard loads and displays the last 300 historical values from Yahoo Finance.

### Static Demo Version

- The `demo_app.py` file is optimized for static hosting on Streamlit Cloud.
- It removes the Kafka dependency and initializes the dashboard just with historical data.

### UI Language Note

- The UI text inside the Streamlit dashboard is in German. The codebase and documentation remain in English.
